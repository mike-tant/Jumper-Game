# Laggy-Bird
5/6/2025

Final Project for CSC 2025.  

Laggy Bird is a game coded in x86 MASM.  It closely resembles the popular game: "Flappy Bird".

The game starts by opening the console and prompting the user with a start screen showing the controls and objective.

After hitting any key to start, the users character (">") is populated and obstacles beginning moving toward the character.

The user must use the space bar to "fly" through the gaps. If the character hits an obstacle the game is over.

Points are calculated based on how long the character lasts without hitting an obstacle.
