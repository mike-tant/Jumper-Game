# Laggy-Bird
5/6/2025

This is for my final Project for CSC2025.  

Laggy Bird is a game coded in x86 MASM.  It closely resembles the popular game: "Flappy Bird".

In the code, you many need to modify the file path after downloading the Irvine libraries.  
Below shows the filepath for my local environment.

The game starts by opening the console and prompting the user with a start screen showing the controls and objective.

After hitting any key to start, the users character ("Â¥") is populated and obstacles beginning moving toward the character.

The user must use the space bar to "fly" through the gaps. If the character hits an obstacle the game is over.

Points are calculated based on how long the character lasts without hitting an obstacle.

If you get a LINK error, the .exe is most likely still running.

Go to task manager and search for "Laggy Bird" and end the executable task.

Below is a screenshot of how I have my file linked in Visual Studio Community 2022.
