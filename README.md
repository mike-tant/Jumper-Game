# Jumper-Game
Final Project for CSC 2025.  Simple Jumper game coded in x86 MASM

The game starts by opening the console and prompting the user with a start screen showing the controls and objective.  After hitting enter to start, the users character is populated and obstacles beginning moving toward the character.  If the character hits an obstacle the game is over.  Points are calculated based on how long the character lasts + how many successful jumps the characeter performs.

*Add Picture of Console Gameplay*

The user is stationary in the x-axis, and can jump in the y-axis.  The obstacles move toward the player.  If possible, the background will move to give the illusion that the character is running toward the obstacles.
